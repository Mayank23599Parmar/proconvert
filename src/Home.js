    		<h3>Data Security</h3>
    		 <p className="mb-0">
                CloudConvert has been trusted by our users and customers since its founding in 2012. No one except you
                will ever have access to your files. We earn money by selling access to our API, not by selling your
                data. Read more about that in our
             Privacy Policy.
